///////What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I changed my directory into a Git repository where I can submit my unversioned projects. Because by initializing a repository, will i be able to create a palace where I could upload my works.

/////How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where my work is temprorally stored before I commit them to the repository. It offers a flexibility, where I can make changes before I finally commit that.

//////How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Use git diff to check if the changes been made is one logical change before commit it.

/////What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

There are several common situation that branches would be helpful, for one is when trying out new features but yet ready to add it to the project. For another, is when a team works on a same project, members could use branch to make copy of the original project and make changes to it without changing the "master" branch.

/////How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps me better understand which branch i'm in and the history of the branch changing.

/////What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is the other branches will merged into the one that's checkedout. To better visualize the relation between the one that is merging and the one that is been merged into.

/////What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Automatic merging Pros: if the automatic merging merges after every changes, it saves time, and make programmer do less job with merging itself. Cons: it might not merge as needed.
Manual Merging Pros: Always merge after logical changes, as needed rather than automadic merge random changes to the projects. Cons: as a human, some time one may forget to merge after certain changes, thus, making the work less effecient.
