///////What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I changed my directory into a Git repository where I can submit my unversioned projects. Because by initializing a repository, will i be able to create a palace where I could upload my works.

/////How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where my work is temprorally stored before I commit them to the repository. It offers a flexibility, where I can make changes before I finally commit that.

//////How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Use git diff to check if the changes been made is one logical change before commit it.
